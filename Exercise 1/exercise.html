    <p class="abt">
      Thomas J. Watson, Sr., in full Thomas John Watson, Sr., (born February 17,
      1874, Campbell, New York, U.S.—died June 19, 1956, New York, New York),
      American industrialist who built the International Business Machines
      Corporation (IBM) into the largest manufacturer of electric typewriters
      and data-processing equipment in the world.
    </p>
    <p class="abt">
      The son of a lumber dealer, Watson studied at the Elmira (New York) School
      of Commerce and then worked as a salesman, first in a retail store and
      then for a small cash register company.He eventually worked his way up to
      general sales manager. Bent on inspiring the dispirited NCR sales force,
      Mr. Watson introduced the motto, "THINK," which later became a widely
      known symbol of IBM
    </p>
    <p class="abt">
      For many years Mr. Watson served as a trustee of Columbia University and
      Lafayette College. He was presented with honorary degrees by 27 colleges
      and universities in the United States and four abroad.
